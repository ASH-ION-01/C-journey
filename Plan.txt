ðŸ§© Pattern-Wise DSA Roadmap (with Examples)
Letâ€™s break it into phases with core patterns â€” all you need is consistency. Iâ€™ll add a 7-day kickoff plan below.

ðŸ”¹ PHASE 1: Arrays + Hashing Patterns
Pattern	Key Concepts	Example Problems
Two Pointers	Sorted array, minimize space	- Two Sum II
- Move Zeroes
- Remove Duplicates
Sliding Window	Fixed or variable size	- Max sum subarray
- Longest substring without repeat
Prefix Sum	Range queries, subarrays	- Subarray Sum = K
- Equilibrium Index
Hashing	Fast lookups	- Two Sum
- Count Distinct Elements
- Longest Consecutive Sequence

ðŸ”¹ PHASE 2: Recursion + Backtracking
Pattern	Key Concepts	Example Problems
Basic Recursion	Base + recursive calls	- Factorial
- Fibonacci
Backtracking	Try â†’ backtrack â†’ try again	- N-Queens
- Rat in Maze
- Subsets / Permutations

ðŸ”¹ PHASE 3: LinkedList + Stack/Queue
Pattern	Key Concepts	Example Problems
Fast/Slow Pointers	Detect loops, mid element	- Detect Cycle
- Middle of LL
- Palindrome LL
Stack Patterns	Monotonic Stack, Histograms	- Next Greater Element
- Valid Parentheses
- Largest Rectangle in Histogram

ðŸ”¹ PHASE 4: Trees + Graphs
Pattern	Key Concepts	Example Problems
DFS / BFS Traversal	Level order, path finding	- Level Order
- Zigzag Traversal
- Clone Graph
Tree Recursion	Post/In/Preorder, Diameter	- Height of Tree
- LCA
- Path Sum
Union Find / DSU	Connected components	- Number of Islands
- Accounts Merge

ðŸ”¹ PHASE 5: Greedy + Dynamic Programming
Pattern	Key Concepts	Example Problems
Greedy Choices	Always local optimum	- Activity Selection
- Gas Station
- Jump Game
DP Patterns	Memoization, Tabulation	- Fibonacci
- 0/1 Knapsack
- Longest Palindromic Substring
